# Computing for Covid 

## A DigitalOcean Marketplace App

This repo uses [Packer scripts](https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-partners) from DigitalOcean as a starting point to configure an Ubuntu 18.04 droplet with [boinc](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/) that automatically attaches itself to the Rosetta@home project as part of the [TEN7 team](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=20117) to fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

You can easily start a brand new droplet from the DigitalOcean Marketplace. Sponsored by [TEN7](https://ten7.com/)
