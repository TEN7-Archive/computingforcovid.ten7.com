<p>The <a href="http://t7.io/cfc">Computing for COVID DigitalOcean Marketplace App</a> is a way for anyone (no tech skills required) to fire up a cloud computer that immediately starts crunching data to help scientists find proteins for the treatment of COVID-19. Costs start at $15/mo for the compute power at DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>This allows you to support researchers at the University of Washington’s <a href="https://www.bakerlab.org/">Baker Lab</a> in their computational requirements as part of their <a href="https://www.ipd.uw.edu/coronavirus/">Coronavirus response</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed the droplet, it starts up, attaches itself to the <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org/">Rosetta@Home</a> project as part of the <a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=20117">Computing for COVID team</a>, and immediately starts to download work to be done.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Follow these <a href="https://computingforcovid.io/setup">detailed setup instructions</a> to set up the droplet. We recommend opening the <a href="https://computingforcovid.io/setup">link</a> in a separate browser tab as you go through the process.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have a DigitalOcean account, sign up using <a href="https://m.do.co/c/5fb69d9c62e4">this link</a> to get a $100 credit</li>
</ul>

<p>The Computing for COVID droplet is self-sufficient; you can set it and forget it! However, if you’d like to see exactly what computations are being done in the droplet, use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boinctui</code> after you’ve connected to the droplet using SSH. See all the details on the droplet’s page in your DigitalOcean dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2>
<p>Send email to <a href="mailto:help@computingforcovid.io">help@computingforcovid.io</a> and we’ll do our best to help out. You can also <a href="https://github.com/ten7/computing-for-covid/issues/new">create an issue</a> in the Github repo.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>
<p>The app is built using <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-partners">Packer scripts</a> from DigitalOcean as a starting point. The scripts configure an Ubuntu 18.04 droplet with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boinc</code> that automatically attaches itself to the Rosetta@home project.</p>

<p>Build scripts are in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/packer</code> directory: <a href="https://github.com/ten7/computing-for-covid/tree/master/packer">https://github.com/ten7/computing-for-covid/tree/master/packer</a>.</p>
